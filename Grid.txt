You're given n*m grid each cell containing either 0 or 1.
A segment is made with only cells with '1'.
If (i,j) cell is '1',then it is connected to atleast an adjacent cell  with value '1' in any of four direction of an existing segments ,
Or the (i,j) cell itself a segment with only one number of '1'.Determine the given grid is mono or poly,and the number of segments exist.
Mono is defined iff there is only one segment otherwise it's poly.

N.B:
 there is atleast one 1 cell.
 Adjacent cells of cell(i,j) are (i+1,j), (i-1,j), (i,j+1), (i,j-1)

{input two integer n,m(1<=n,m<=10000); and n*m grids of integers;}

print wether it is mono or poly and in next line print the number of segments

Tc 1 :
4 5
1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0

Output:
poly
3

Tc 2:
2 2 
1 0 
0 0

Output:
mono
1

Tc 3:
1 0 0 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0

Output:
mono
1
