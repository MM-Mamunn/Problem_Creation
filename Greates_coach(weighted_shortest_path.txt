							Greatest Coach
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You're the greatest coach of Football history.You can analyze every factor of the game and you always have a plan ready for the playing 11 of your team just before the match starts. your plan contains the passes that can be made between players with 100% accuracy. Your plan contains 'm' line.Each of 'm' line contains 3 integers (u,v,w) that indicates player no 'u' & player no'v' can pass the ball between each other with 100% accuracy ,and they are at 'w' unit distance . Your plan is valid for any moment of the game. Your best and only Center forward player who is player no '11' has a 100% accuracy to score a goal if he get the ball. You're given the plan and an interger n, the instance of ball position that describes that at that particular moment the ball is on the foot of your player no 'n'. Is it possible to tell that it would be a goal with certainty? if yes, print the minimum distance the ball traveled before the scoring shot was made by your CF from the player 'n', also print the path in reverse order, that is from the center forward to player no 'n'
(two integers 'n', 'm';
next m lines contains three integers 'u', 'v' and 'w'

1<=n<=11 , 1<=m<=60,
'u' doesn't equal 'v' and 1<=u,v<=11
1<=w<=200 )

Print 'NO GOAL' if it's a not  goal else print 'GOAL'  and the shortest distance the ball has traveled and the path in reverse order that is from 11 to the player no 'n'
